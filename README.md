Food Magazine Ratings Analysis with MongoDB & Jupyter Notebook

Evaluating and analyzing ratings data from a Food Magazine, to help provide more information and analysis on where to focus future magazine articles. 


## Tools Used:

MongoDB (NoSQL database) Jupyter Notebook, Luna Modeler (Database Design Tool)

## What I Learned:

In this NoSQL challenge, I learned basic concepts of NoSQL databases and how they differ from SQL databases. I also learned how to query NoSQL databases using MongoDB Query Language (MQL) and how to use the Luna Modeler, a Database Design tool, to define and interact with MongoDB collections.

## How These Tools and Applications Can be Beneficial:

These tools can be beneficial in many ways. NoSQL databases are especially useful when dealing with large amounts of unstructured data, such as social media posts or IoT data. MongoDB provides scalability and flexibility to the database schema as it allows adding new fields dynamically without affecting the existing data. Jupyter Notebook is a powerful application that allows for thorough and methodical data analysis and also has many many tools available to import and use in your analysis which makes this an extremely valuable Application. Finally, Mongoose provides an easy-to-use interface for exploring the database, defining each collection and their relationships.
